# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
Technology was like a playground for me since I was a child. I grew with trying to scarp car's motor to actually building arduino base wifi controlled drone and many other stuffs. Once I dream of being a engineer but some events in my life took my interest towards hacking , so later I explored ethical hacking for a while till when I realize I feel more amazing when I built something rather trying to protect Something. So then when I was in class 9 I wrote my first program. And since then I never turned back again , I got my first freelance project when I was in class 12th that paid me 10,000 rupees. Later I got oppurtunity to work with a tech company called HOTOBOOK as a full stack web developer. The journey was amazing but I know that I only knew very few things and need to learn a lot. Amfoss will be surely help me in the learning process and I feel that amFoss can think of choosing me on the basis of my eager to learn and explore in this field. I love developing things that can be used and make other life better.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I know I jumped to developing portion very early in my life , that's why , My basics of programming i.e data structure is not that clear. So I started learning data structure and algorithm the day I started to do amFoss task and The flutter part is very new and interesting to me since mobile app is everywhere and it is easy to access. So I will try learning that as well. And the last one is (Time management), try to figure out that in order balance my academics and this journey.

## How would you contribute back to the club?
I will do whatever I can. The concept of learn in public fascinates me alot. Amfoss club is the best way to do that and I will do whatever I can to contribute back to this club.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
My feedback is just "WOW". The way we all are introduced, group names with planets , discord server, tasks, meetings and the mentors is just amazing. The steepest learning curve I have till the date.
