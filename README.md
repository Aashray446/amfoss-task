## How I approach each task?
Task - 0: I have previously tried the Ubuntu OS, there were many issues I faced at that time. So this time I took help from a blog and a youtube to dual boot.

Task - 1: First I thought about making my own script to star all repo and after some research, I realize that it was a bad idea ':-). So use the given Script to do that.

Task - 2: For this particular task I had fun doing, I straightly dive down to the task and googled related commands to perform the particular instruction.

Task - 3: This was the last task that I focused on, As I was a little bit scared that I won't get it all. I was trying to learn data structure and algorithms before trying out these problems but I realized that these skills can't be mastered within a month so tried out the task which I understood, I was able to complete 4 of them by myself and for others,  I took help from youtube to understand and approach the problem.  One of them didn't qualify all the test cases.

Task - 4: "Python" -- I love this language, I had some previous experience in working with API but with PHP so I directly google how to send HTTP requests in python, did some trials, and then refer to the given website to know about the available interface of API and to generate the key.

Task - 5: "C" -- Never worked with so At first just try to debug the spell mistakes and ";" (as most of the programming languages have similar-sounding words). Changed the white space to which I am comfortable and tried to correct all the mistakes by eye and with the help of vs code so I can at least run the program. Then, trying to debug the program by calculating in my mind but I failed badly :-(, But then I learned how to properly use the debugger, and that saved my life. :-)

Task - 6: "Flutter" - very knew language and type of framework. Firstly, get a basic idea of Dart and Flutter (Everything is widget), then took help from youtube and referred to the documentation to make the Intro Screen.

Task - 7: Watched 12min video on youtube about to get started, Searched about any available framework which is made for web scraping, and then decided to work with the Colly framework and Later realized that colly didn't work with Js rendered websites, so then used Geyser to achieve the task. Took a lot of hustling and googling to complete this task since go is a very different type of language.

Task - 8: I was very familiar with the given tech stack and package, So directly dived into the task and solved it.

Task - 9: I was thinking about making my own web portfolio, So I utilized the given opportunity and take the help of "Angular" to make it.

Task - 10: Week -1: Scratch Programming  -- Our teacher also teaching the same topic so I thought It will be better to spend time on the tasks that make me learn something new so I left this task.
Week - 2, Week -3, Week -4: I know by attempting these tasks I will learn something new but I was familiar with most of the topics explained and due to the time restriction and academic pressure I shift my energy and time to other tasks. :-(

Task - 11: Designing was never easy for me but it is actually fun after I started. Thanks to adobe spark.

Task - 12: Finally I can say that I know something about Blockchain :-) Took the help of some youtube videos to get an idea about it and then implemented using JAVA.

Task - 13: I was very interested in circuits and robotics from my childhood, previously made a drone (custom flight controller), amplifiers e.t.c and had some experience of tinkercad, Arduino so directly jumped to the task and completed it.

Task - 14: I was very unknown to SSH, so tried to learn about SSH and why it is used from youtube and then dived into the task, stuck, googled and the loop goes on till I finished the task.

Task - 15: I was able to complete till first two questions, There are solutions available on the internet so Now I will try understand how to the next ones.
